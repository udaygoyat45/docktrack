# Docktrack: CLI Tool for Code Feature Tracking and Documentation

Docktrack (public executable: `auto_documentation`) is a command-line interface (CLI) written in OCaml that helps developers track features in their codebase and manage documentation updates. It integrates seamlessly with Git, providing custom subcommands under both `git` and `dock` namespaces.

## üöÄ Features

* **View Structures**

  * `view-code-tree`: Display the current code tree (files and their associated features).
  * `view-features`: Show the hierarchical feature tree.
  * `view-feature <feature_name>`: Inspect metadata and updates for a specific feature.

* **Manage Files & Features**

  * `add-file`: Prompt to add a new file to the code tree and associate it with features.
  * `remove-files`: Remove files from the code tree.
  * `add-feature`: Create a new feature node in the feature tree (with title, description, URL).
  * `remove-feature <feature_name>`: Delete a feature (except the root).

* **Track Documentation Updates**

  * `add-update`: Add a documentation update under a feature (title, content, timestamp).
  * `view-updates <feature_name>`: List all updates for a feature.
  * `view-update <feature_name> <update_title>`: Show details of a specific update.
  * `document-next-update <feature_name>`: Mark the next undocumented update as documented.
  * `document-update <feature_name> <update_title>`: Mark a specific update documented.
  * `remove-update <feature_name> <update_title>`: Remove an update from a feature.

* **Git Integration**

  * Run standard Git subcommands via `git <subcommand>`.
  * Custom grouping under `git` and `dock` to keep workflows unified.

All state is persisted in a S-expression file at `.docktrack/code_tree.sexp` in the project root.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

* OCaml (tested with OCaml 4.14+)
* [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) (OCaml package manager)
* [dune](https://dune.build/) (build system)

### Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
opam install dune core core_unix lwt ppx_jane ppx_sexp_conv
```

### Build

```bash
dune build
```

### Run

Use the `auto_documentation` executable via `dune exec`:

```bash
dune exec auto_documentation -- <namespace> <command> [args]
# e.g.
#  View feature tree:
 dune exec auto_documentation -- dock view-features

#  Add a file:
 dune exec auto_documentation -- dock add-file
```

Alternatively, install globally:

```bash
dune install
auto_documentation
```

and invoke directly:

```bash
auto_documentation <namespace> <command> [args]
```
